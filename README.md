# hello-world
Initial github repository
My name is Sam Matthews and I am learning to code.
One of the things I need to learn how to use, is github.
Potential employers scrub through your github profiles in order to ascertain the level of skills you have in the different languages.
Today I have kicked off my learning in JavaScript.
